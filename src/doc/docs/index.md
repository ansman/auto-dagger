Auto Dagger
===
Auto Dagger allows you to automate some setup with Dagger and Hilt.

For example you can annotate `@Singleton` scoped objects with `@AutoInitialize` and have the be initialized during app
launch.

This is done using Hilt and AndroidX Startup.

You can find the project on GitHub in the [ansman/auto-dagger](https://github.com/ansman/auto-dagger) repo.

If you're looking javadoc/dokka you can find it here [here]({{ gradle.dokkaLink }}).
