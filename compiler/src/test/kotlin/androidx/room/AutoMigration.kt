/**
 * Declares an automatic migration on a Database.
 *
 * An automatic migration is a [androidx.room.migration.Migration] that is generated
 * via the use of database schema files at two versions of a [androidx.room.RoomDatabase].
 * Room automatically detects changes on the database between these two schemas,
 * and constructs a [androidx.room.migration.Migration] to migrate between the
 * two versions. In case of ambiguous scenarios (e.g. column/table rename/deletes), additional
 * information is required, and can be provided via the
 * [androidx.room.migration.AutoMigrationSpec] property.
 *
 * An auto migration must define the 'from' and 'to' versions of the schema for which a migration
 * implementation will be generated. A class that implements AutoMigrationSpec can be declared in
 * the [androidx.room.migration.AutoMigrationSpec] property to either
 * provide more information for ambiguous scenarios or execute callbacks during the migration.
 *
 * If there are any column/table renames/deletes between the two versions of the database
 * provided then it is said that there are ambiguous scenarios in the migration. In
 * such scenarios then an [androidx.room.migration.AutoMigrationSpec] is
 * required and the class provided must be annotated with the relevant change annotation(s):
 * [RenameColumn], [RenameTable], [DeleteColumn] or [DeleteTable]. When
 * no ambiguous scenario is present, then the [androidx.room.migration.AutoMigrationSpec]
 * property is optional.
 *
 * If an auto migration is defined for a database, then [androidx.room.Database.exportSchema]
 * must be set to true.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * @Database(
 *    version = MusicDatabase.LATEST_VERSION,
 *    entities = [
 *        Song.class,
 *        Artist.class
 *    ],
 *    autoMigrations = [
 *        AutoMigration (
 *            from = 1,
 *            to = 2
 *        ),
 *        AutoMigration (
 *            from = 2,
 *            to = 3,
 *            spec = MusicDatabase.MyExampleAutoMigration::class
 *        )
 *    ],
 *    exportSchema = true
 * )
 * abstract class MusicDatabase  : RoomDatabase() {
 *    const val LATEST_VERSION = 3
 *
 *    @DeleteTable(deletedTableName = "Album")
 *    @RenameTable(fromTableName = "Singer", toTableName = "Artist")
 *    @RenameColumn(
 *        tableName = "Song",
 *        fromColumnName = "songName",
 *        toColumnName = "songTitle"
 *     )
 *    @DeleteColumn(fromTableName = "Song", deletedColumnName = "genre")
 *    class MyExampleAutoMigration : AutoMigrationSpec {
 *        @Override
 *        override fun onPostMigrate(db: SupportSQLiteDatabase) {
 *            // Invoked once auto migration is done
 *        }
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
