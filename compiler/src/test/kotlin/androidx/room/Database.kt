/**
 * Marks a class as a RoomDatabase.
 *
 * The class should be an abstract class and extend [androidx.room.RoomDatabase].
 *
 * You can receive an implementation of the class via
 * [androidx.room.Room.databaseBuilder] or
 * [androidx.room.Room.inMemoryDatabaseBuilder].
 *
 * ```
 * // Song and Album are classes annotated with @Entity.
 * @Database(version = 1, entities = [Song::class, Album::class])
 * abstract class MusicDatabase : RoomDatabase {
 *   // SongDao is a class annotated with @Dao.
 *   abstract fun getSongDao(): SongDao
 *
 *   // AlbumDao is a class annotated with @Dao.
 *   abstract fun getArtistDao(): ArtistDao
 *
 *   // SongAlbumDao is a class annotated with @Dao.
 *   abstract fun getSongAlbumDao(): SongAlbumDao
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The example above defines a class that has 2 tables and 3 DAO classes that are used to access it.
 * There is no limit on the number of [Entity] or [Dao] classes but they must be unique
 * within the Database.
 *
 * Instead of running queries on the database directly, you are highly recommended to create
 * [Dao] classes. Using Dao classes will allow you to abstract the database communication in
 * a more logical layer which will be much easier to mock in tests (compared to running direct
 * SQL queries). It also automatically does the conversion from `Cursor` to your application
 * data classes so you don't need to deal with lower level database APIs for most of your data
 * access.
 *
 * Room also verifies all of your queries in [Dao] classes while the application is being
 * compiled so that if there is a problem in one of the queries, you will be notified instantly.
 *
 * To automatically generate a migration between two versions of the database, assuming you have
 * the relevant schema files, you are recommended to use [AutoMigration] annotations. Note
 * that if an autoMigration is defined in a database, `exportSchema` must be `true`.
 *
 * @see [Dao]
 * @see [Entity]
 * @see [AutoMigration]
 * @see [androidx.room.RoomDatabase]
